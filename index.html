        <h1>CSCE 190: Robert Keogh</h1>
        <div class="about">
            <h2 id="about-me-heading">About Me</h2>
            <p> I will be a person who:
                My family consisting of my wife and kid(s), my best friend and brother Tim, maybe people from the Marine Corps who can make the trip. People will say
                that my life was such a roller coaster, but I made it through it despite the hurdles. Hopefully they will describe me as someone who was comedic, and
                straight forward.
                Passion:
                What do I really love to do at work?
                I love to tinker with ideas, and solve problems
                What do I really love to do in my personal life?
                Shoot weapons, play video games, learn about interesting topics
                Imagination
                If I had unlimited time and resources, and knew I could not fail, what would I choose to do? I would:
                I would create a veteran only neighborhood. It would have the military feel away from the military and its constructs. Also precious to my heart, would be
                owning a huge piece of land where all the animals unwanted, or in the shelters, could roam free from danger, and know they have a safe place to sleep
                and eat.
                Vision
                My life's journey is...
                Im attempting to live a life that is well diversified. Something people and family members will look back on, and say I lived a life worth living. I would also
                want to be remembered for being someone that can be counted on during hard times, and never judged despite circumstances.</p>
